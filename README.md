# Fake News Detection Using NLP

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting and classifying fake news using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By gathering and preprocessing news data, extracting features, and training machine learning models, we create a tool to accurately identify misleading information. The goal is to enhance media credibility and provide a reliable, real-time fake news detection application.

## Project Description
This project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and preprocess a diverse dataset of news articles.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Utilize NLP techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and sentiment analysis.
3. **Model Development**: Train models using Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, and BERT.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Implementation and Deployment**: Develop a user-friendly application or API for real-time fake news detection.
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the dataset and retrain models to adapt to new fake news types.
